## Map based tool for deciding where friends should go out

1. I have a group of friends, and we all want to go out
2. We each can propose locations to go out
3. We can each vote on or rank proposed locations
4. Some algorithm runs to present top choices given raking/voting
5. Voting closes at determined time
6. You go out!
